## Remotely Connecting

Now you are ready to remotely connect.

* Open a terminal in VS code and type the following: **ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu** with the zz replaced by the letters in your course-specific account.
* It will then ask if you want to continue connecting. Enter yes.
* It will then ask for your password. Enter your password. *Note that the characters you type will not show up on your screen.*
